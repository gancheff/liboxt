oxt2 - open X toolkit -- second release
	version 0.2

this is oxt2.a graphical toolkit based on Xlib.

everything can be explained in the sources, this work is
far from being complete so don't bug me about the lack of
documentation

installing oxt is easy.there're no autoconfs and automakes
so you'll have to edit Makefile to make a configuration for
*YOUR* system.when done type:
make
and if there're no errors, try this as root:
make install
this will install the library in /usr/local.you can specify
another directory by editing the PREFIX macro in Makefile

currently supported widgets:
	window - class oxt_window
	box - class oxt_box
	label - class oxt_label
	pixmap - class oxt_pixmap
	button - class oxt_button
	progress bar - class oxt_progress

oxt now supports asynchronous file handling and timers.look at
oxt_util.cc for more information

sample sources are provided in ./examples/
they should be ehough to get you started

if you have fresh ideas and *think* that you could
be a part of the project - you know what to do
