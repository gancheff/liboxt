oxt - Open X Toolkit
	0.1

oxt is a toolkit library for the X Window system written entirely in C
with the help of some black magic and a lot of coke.oxt was born from
its previous versions also known as purelib (i found another library
under that name so i changed it) and billie (base interface library
with light interactive extensions).
as you can see the library is in beginning stage so don't expect much.
